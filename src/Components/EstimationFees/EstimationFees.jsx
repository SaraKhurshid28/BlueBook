        <p>
          The BlueBook Estimator always like to hear from clients about the
          budget of the project so we have no fix rates about our services. But
          ofcourse, we charge per project, and remain very low so that our
          clients can bid more projects with minimum fees. Estimating fee can be
          like $150, $250, $350, $550 and so on. We do jobs even in $75, $100 or
          it all depend on size/scope of the project.

              bidding whole project or selected trades. After a detailed review
